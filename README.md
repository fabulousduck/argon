## dependencies


```
  Go
```

## near future todo's

1. Lexer
  * fix problem with lexer messing up reading litteral strings
  * make type assignment function
  * make function for combining char and int for types like int32/64 and uint32/64
  * make eat function so the parser can get the tokens from the lexer
  * rename main function so the parser.go file can have it and call the lexer itself
2. Parser
  * everything :^)
